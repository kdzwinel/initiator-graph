    <h1>Top third party initiators vizualized</h1>
    <p>This page vizualizes top third party domains found on the web connected by their top initiators.</p>
    <p><i>e.g. since resources from google-analytics.com are loaded by googletagmanager.com in 65% of the cases, those two will be connected by an arrow pointing from google-analytics.com to googletagmanager.com. Since cloudflare.com is mainly loaded directly by sites and doesn't load any other resources from big third-party domains, it will have no arrows pointing at or from it.</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Size of a node reflects how prevalent given domain is as a third party on the web.</li>
      <li>Only domains with prevalence >= 0.5% are visualized.</li>
      <li>Nodes representing domains owned by five biggest companies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Adobe) are
        color-coded.</li>
      <li>Visualization based on April 2023 snapshot of <a
